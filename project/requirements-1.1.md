"Excellent progress on the UI. For this next iteration, let's focus on user education, acoustic comfort, and data integrity. Please implement the following:

1. **Informational Layer:** Add descriptive tooltips or sub-labels for each preset (e.g., Alpha: 'Creative Flow', Gamma: 'Peak Concentration'). Include a persistent 'Headphones Required' badge in the UI.
2. **Audio Layering (Ambient Noise):** Integrate a Pink Noise and Brown Noise generator using the Web Audio API. Add a 'Background Texture' selector and a slider to mix the volume between the binaural tones and the ambient noise.
3. **UX Polish & Safety:** Add a simple 'How to use' modal or section explaining the benefits of each frequency. Include a safety disclaimer regarding driving or operating machinery.
4. **Analytics Fix:** Debug the Chart logic to correctly display the last 7 days of activity from IndexedDB on the X-axis, replacing the 'Invalid Date' labels.
5. **Branding:** Subtlely incorporate the 'Codes and Tags' logo or typography style to align with my professional brand."
